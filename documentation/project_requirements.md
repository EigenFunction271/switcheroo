Project Title: Day-Night Toggle Toy Site

Goal:
Create a single-page, fully responsive toy website where clicking a toggle switch flips the entire page between day and night modes. The transition must be smooth and visually playful, including animated sun/moon graphics and background color shifts.

Key Requirements:

One-page layout

Toggle switch animates smoothly with sun/moon icon sliding

Background and text adapt to match the theme

Responsive design for mobile and desktop

CSS-only animations preferred (no external animation libs)

Assets must match the playful 3D style

Deploy-ready for Vercel


User Stories:
As a visitor, I see a greeting ("Good Morning!" or "Good Night!") and a toggle switch.
When I click the switch, the background, text, and switch visuals all animate between themes.
